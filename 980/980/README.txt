Two steps to run the code:



1. enter “make merge” to compile and link the source code.



2. enter “./merge + filenames” to get the result. There are 15 parameters in total. The first 10 parameters are the name of the files. The last 5 parameters are used to control the simulated annealing algorithm, which have default values. At least two filenames should be entered.



Environment requirement: 



1. should install “Boost Graph Library”, which can be download from https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/



2. should install “FLTK”, which can be download from http://www.fltk.org/software.php?VERSION=fltk-1.3.x-r11608


Unfinished part:

1. The interchange operation is not finished in class Clo_Red_Graph and class Merge.
